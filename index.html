        <h3>About Music :</h3><br>
        Music is sound that has been organized by using rhythm, melody or harmony. If someone bangs saucepans while cooking, it makes noise. If a person bangs saucepans or pots in a rhythmic way,
         they are making a simple type of music.

        There are four things which music has most of the time:

    Music often has pitch. This means high and low notes. Tunes are made of notes that go up or down or stay on the same pitch.

    Music often has dynamics. This means whether it is quiet or loud or somewhere in between.
    Music often has timbre. This is a French word (pronounced: "TAM-br"). The "timbre" of a sound is the way that a sound is interesting.
    The sort of sound might be harsh, gentle, dry, warm, or something else. Timbre is what makes a clarinet sound different from an oboe,
    and what makes one person's voice sound different from another person.
